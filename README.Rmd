## Overview

The tidyomics is a set of packages that work in harmony because they share common data representations and API design. The __tidyomics__ package is designed to make it easy to install and load core packages from the tidyomics in a single command.

If you'd like to learn how to use the tidyomics effectively, the best place to start is [R for data science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz).

## Installation

::: .pkgdown-release
```{r eval = FALSE}
# Install from CRAN
install.packages("tidyomics")
```
:::

::: .pkgdown-devel
```{r eval = FALSE}
# Install the development version from GitHub
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("tidy-biology/tidyomics")
```
:::

If you're compiling from source, you can run `pak::pkg_system_requirements("tidyomics")`, to see the complete set of system packages needed on your machine.

## Usage

`library(tidyomics)` will load the core tidyomics packages: 

* [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyomics.org), for data visualisation.
* [dplyr](https://dplyr.tidyomics.org), for data manipulation.
* [tidyr](https://tidyr.tidyomics.org), for data tidying.
* [readr](https://readr.tidyomics.org), for data import.
* [purrr](https://purrr.tidyomics.org), for functional programming.
* [tibble](https://tibble.tidyomics.org), for tibbles, a modern re-imagining of data frames.
* [stringr](https://github.com/tidyomics/stringr), for strings.
* [forcats](https://github.com/tidyomics/forcats), for factors.
* [lubridate](https://github.com/tidyomics/lubridate), for date/times.

You also get a condensed summary of conflicts with other packages you have loaded:

```{r example}
library(tidyomics)
```

You can see conflicts created later with `tidyomics_conflicts()`:

```{r conflicts}
library(MASS)
tidyomics_conflicts()
```

And you can check that all tidyomics packages are up-to-date with `tidyomics_update()`:

```{r update, eval = FALSE}
tidyomics_update()
#> The following packages are out of date:
#>  * broom (0.4.0 -> 0.4.1)
#>  * DBI   (0.4.1 -> 0.5)
#>  * Rcpp  (0.12.6 -> 0.12.7)
#>  
#> Start a clean R session then run:
#> install.packages(c("broom", "DBI", "Rcpp"))
```

## Packages

As well as the core tidyomics, installing this package also installs a selection of other packages that you're likely to use frequently, but probably not in every analysis. This includes packages for:

*   Working with specific types of vectors:

    * [hms](https://github.com/tidyomics/hms), for times.
    
*   Importing other types of data:

    * [feather](https://github.com/wesm/feather), for sharing with Python and other languages.
    * [haven](https://github.com/tidyomics/haven), for SPSS, SAS and Stata files.
    * [httr](https://github.com/r-lib/httr), for web apis.
    * [jsonlite](https://github.com/jeroen/jsonlite) for JSON.
    * [readxl](https://github.com/tidyomics/readxl), for `.xls` and `.xlsx` files.
    * [rvest](https://github.com/tidyomics/rvest), for web scraping.
    * [xml2](https://github.com/r-lib/xml2), for XML.

*   Modelling

    * [modelr](https://github.com/tidyomics/modelr), for modelling within a pipeline
    * [broom](https://github.com/tidymodels/broom), for turning models into 
      tidy data
